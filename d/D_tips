4. Casting
(01:33:22 PM) h3: x2cast: you can cast objects to void* and you can
cast it back. but to be safe, cast it first to Object, then to your
class. references don't change when casting, but as wm4 said, casts
between classes are checked, so casting through Object is a safety
measure. so Foo -> void* -> Object -> Foo is ok, but it's different
with interfaces...
(01:33:36 PM) h3: IFoo -> void* -> Object -> IFoo is _not_ safe.
(01:33:48 PM) h3: IFoo -> Object -> void* -> Object -> IFoo is
(01:33:54 PM) h3: IFoo -> void* -> IFoo is.
(01:35:11 PM) h3: ah, and   Foo -> void* -> Foo is faster than Foo ->
Object -> Foo
