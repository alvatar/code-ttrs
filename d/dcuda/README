
For cutil you need custom DLLs.
	Build instruction:
		In cutil.h you need change:
		    #define CUTIL_API __stdcall
		to:
			#define CUTIL_API __cdecl
	or you can download all DLLs from:
		http://gruby.team0xf.com/dcudaBin.7z
		or
		from 'bin' directory in http://team0xf.com:8080/gruby/

Known issues:
	- Missing cutGetCmdLineArgumentListstr and cutWriteFiled in cutil DLLs.
	- Artifacts on titlebar in sampleGL.
