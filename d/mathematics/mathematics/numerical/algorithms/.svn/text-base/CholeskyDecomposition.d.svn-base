/*

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPOTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
*  positive definite matrix A.
*
*  The factorization has the form
*     A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*     A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*  where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.
*
*  This is the block version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
*                positive definite, and the factorization could not be
*                completed.
