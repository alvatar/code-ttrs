## USB power:

You can just jump down to editing the config.txt file and rebooting, if that doesnâ€™t work you will need to rpi-update

sudo rpi-update

You will have to reboot afterwards

sudo reboot

Now edit the config.txt file

sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Add this line to the bottom of the file, it replaces the old safe_mode_gpio=4

max_usb_current=1

Ctrl+X, Y and Enter to save

Reboot the Pi again to enable the GPIO pin 38

sudo reboot

Now check to see if the hard drive is visible

sudo blkid

You should now see a /dev/sda1 device
