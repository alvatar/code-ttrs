                   Object Hierarchy Syntax for Gauche

                      http://synthcode.com/scheme/

                            version 0.5

This directory contains the general let-objects syntax for Gauche, as
well as specific object rules syntax for building Gauche-gtk widget
hierarchies.

To install run "make install".  This will install both the
util.let-objects, and uui.* modules for Gauche-gtk.  uui stands for
"Universal User Interface" but is subject to change in future releases.

Documentation is not yet complete.  For now you can see the examples
directory for an idea of how it is used.
