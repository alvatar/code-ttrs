The Scheme scripts in this directory are ported from examples that come
with Gauche-gtk, which are ports of the examples from Gtk2.  (The
original source can be found under the examples directory of Gtk source
code).

Since the original example code comes with Gtk which is LGPL,
I assume the ported Scheme code should be also covered by LGPL.
A copy of LGPL is included in the directory.
