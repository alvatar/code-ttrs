vctlib release 0.2 is a (still) pre-beta release.


1) Features
=============================

vctlib supports:

- 32 or 64 bits floating points vectors and matrixes, as defined in
  the first lines of vct.scm
- basic linear algebra (no matrix inverse)
- lots of vector and matrix manipulation functions (vct-split,
  vct-append, vct-reverse, matrix-vertical-flip,
  matrix-horizontal-flip, matrix-replicate, etc.)
- trigonometric function (vct-sin, vct-tan, vct-log, matrix-sin, etc.)
- statistics (vct-mean, vct-median, vct-sum, vct-min, matrix-min,
  etc.)
- higher order manipulation functions (vct-map, vct-do!, matrix-map)
- functions on rows/columns of matrixes (matrix-sum-rows,
  matrix-prod-rows, matrix-mean-rows, matrix-median-columns, etc.)
- convolutions: vct-conv, matrix-conv
- subsampling by averaging (matrix-subsampling)
- functions of rows/columns and a vector (matrix-vct-row-map,
  matrix-vct-row-add, matrix-vct-row-multiply, matrix-vct-column-map,
  etc.)
- Matlab-style compact equation notation with macro with-matrix.


2) Quick-install instructions
=============================

To use the vctlib library, include the files you need in your project.

This is the architecture of the library for this version:

- matrix.scm needs vct.scm
- vct.scm needs general-lib.scm
- general-lib.scm needs the Gambit Scheme system
- srfi-1.scm is the srfi-1
- fft3w.scm is an interface to fftw3 (if available)
- gambit-blas.scm is an interface to BLAS (if available)
- vct-blas.scm interfaces vct.scm and matrix.scm to gambit-blas.scm
- vct-C.scm define some vct.scm function in C language
- basic and incomplete output to ppm image format
- compile.sh compiles fft3.scm, gambit-blas.scm and vct-C.scm for c-lambda support in the interpreter

Compiling:

We recommend that you use the following options when compiling vctlib
with gsc:

(declare
  (standard-bindings)
  (extended-bindings) 
  (inline) 
  (constant-fold) 
  (lambda-lift)
  (not safe) 
  (block))
