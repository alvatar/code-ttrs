# TODOLIST file for vctlib: a typed floating point vector and matrix
# library for Gambit Scheme (December, 2006)

# $Id: $


- Compile without warnings

- Finish interface to BLAS

- Finish interface to FFTW3

- Write interface to LAPACK3

- A with-vct macro to allow Matlab-style notation for vct (analog to
  with-matrix)

- n-dimensional matrix type

- matrix-inverse function (in LAPACK3 functions)

- SVD decomposition (in LAPACK3 functions)

- More documentation

- A complete test suite

- Benchmarks comparing vctlib with compiled C, Matlab, Lush (at least
  for vector multiplication/addition).
