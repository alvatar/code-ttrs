Cosas que hacen perder el tiempo:
---------------------------------
Travel: You might think that it's going to speed up your project by bringing different parts of your team together.
Interview: If you go straight from a resume to a paid trial task, you get to the work more quickly.
Conference call: conference call time is closely correlated with project failure.
Architect in advance: If you wait to do something, you might never have to do it. The work you didn't do is 100% time savings.
Estimate: A lot of technology, skill, and time goes into estimating how long things will take.
Add project managers: teams get slower when you add project managers.
