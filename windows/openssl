To build OpenSSL, you need a working Perl installation.

Download OpenSSL from its official website and decompress the archive.
Windows 32/64 bits - MinGW

You must run these commands from a MSys console.

For 32 bits:

    perl Configure mingw no-shared no-asm --prefix=/c/OpenSSL

For 64 bits:

    perl Configure mingw64 no-shared no-asm --prefix=/C/OpenSSL-x64

Then:

    make depend

    make

    make install

The make depend line is only needed on the most recent OpenSSL version if you specified any of the no-... options


Note that this will compile OpenSSL in static mode.

If at some point you get a "make (e=2):" error, ensure you don't have another "make.exe" in your PATH or just type /bin/make instead of make.

perl Configure mingw no-asm --prefix=/usr/local --openssldir=/usr/local/openssl

perl Configure mingw64 no-asm --prefix=/usr/local --openssldir=/usr/local/openssl
make 



None of this seems to be necessary if using GCC-4.8, that is MinGW is properly configured with fstab's mingw volume


* Remove test/*c 3 files that give error at compile time
(or better, uncompress with tar xvf)

* Add two header includes to the dso_win32.c file line 63.
#include "windef.h"
#include "winbase.h"
